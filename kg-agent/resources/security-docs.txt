CloudVault Security Best Practices

Security is our top priority. This document outlines the security features and best practices for using CloudVault.

Encryption:
All files are encrypted using AES-256 encryption before leaving your device. We use zero-knowledge encryption, meaning even CloudVault employees cannot access your files. Your encryption keys are derived from your password using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations.

Two-Factor Authentication:
We strongly recommend enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for your account. CloudVault supports:
- Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) via apps like Google Authenticator
- SMS verification codes
- Hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan Security Key)

Password Requirements:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Must include uppercase and lowercase letters
- Must include at least one number
- Must include at least one special character
- Cannot reuse previous 5 passwords

File Sharing Security:
When sharing files, you can:
- Set expiration dates (1 day to 1 year)
- Require password protection
- Limit downloads to specific number
- Revoke access at any time
- View audit logs of who accessed your files

Compliance:
CloudVault is compliant with SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 standards. We undergo regular security audits by independent third parties.
